# 📚 Data Structures and Algorithms in TypeScript

![TypeScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/TypeScript-3178C6?style=for-the-badge&logo=typescript&logoColor=white)


This repository contains my practice and implementations of **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** using **TypeScript**.  
It is organized into well-structured folders such as **Arrays, Stacks, Queues, Linked Lists, Trees, Graphs, Hash Tables, Heaps, Recursion, and more**.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Implementations of popular **data structures**:
  - Array
  - Linked List
  - Stack
  - Queue
  - Trees (Binary Tree, AVL Tree, Trie, Heap, Priority Queue)
  - Graph
  - Hash Tables

- Implementations of **algorithms**:
  - Search Algorithms
  - Sorting Algorithms
  - String Manipulation

- Each implementation is written in **TypeScript** for type safety.

``` 
- Each folder contains relevant implementations and examples.

## Usage
You can use the implementations in this repository as a reference or directly in your TypeScript projects. Each implementation includes example usage to help you understand how to utilize the data structures and algorithms effectively.
Explore the folders for specific data structures or algorithms.

Modify main.ts to test different implementations.

Great for interview preparation or improving problem-solving skills.
